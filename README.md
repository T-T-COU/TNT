# Development rule
* We are going to treat the default "master" branch as our production and therefore create a single branch for development named `dev`.
* We are going to make a commitment on your own branch with your feature name, make a PR on `dev` branch.
* Once any change to any fie that has passed all testing on our development branch, then it is ready to merge in production.
